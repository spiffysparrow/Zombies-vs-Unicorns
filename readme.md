# Zombies VS Unicorns

[Live Project Link][zombie]

The world has been overrun with Unicorns and it is your job as the only scrappy little zombie left to take it back.
It's a project I created to test out JavaScript game development.

Arrow keys walk, spacebar jumps, and shift triggers rage mode where you run faster and kill any unicorns you hit. Unicorns hurt you normally, and you only have 3 undead lives so use them wisely. The score is kept in the top right corner, you must get all those pesky unicorns to win.
